Description: This program prints out a liost of numbers, prints out the same
list backwards and skips every other number in the list,i prints the largest
number in the list, and prints the average of four numbers.

To compile the program use $ make
To run the program use $ ./a.out

Example of normal output:
Program starting...

The maximum value in the array is 196 
The integer average of 5, 15, 32, and -2 is 12

How I tested my program: 
When debugging the the compilation errors below, I was able to see the
error outputs from the terminal and fix the syntax errors.
For the logical errors I tested the program using gdb and found that there were
three errors. The first being an infinted while loop that was missing an
incramentor. The second being the average function adding its parameters
incorrectly, and the third being the everyotherreversed file missing the last
element it was supposed to print.

README questions:

1) It is an acdemic integrity violation to turn in code written by someone else
you are claiming credit for someone elses work

2)
Compiltion error in pa0.c: #include "pa0" ->#include "pa0.h"
Compilation error in findMax.c line26: i -> int i
Compilation error in pa0.c line 43: for(); { -> for () {
Compilation error in pa0.c line 61: "v4"-> v4
Compilation error in pa0.h line 26: array -> *array

3)printf("Program starting...\n");
4) The same C code is displayed because the assembly code is running
5)I am now in avg4
6) $1 = 20
7) $2 = 52
8) $3 = 12, p$r0, p/d $r0
9) Average
10) 196, C4
11) A breakpoint is he line where the gdb will pause while running code
12) In this specific program I would be debugging avg4, but I would normally be
debugging the add function
13)$sp is astack pointer
14) printf("%d" + "%d" + " %c %d", b, b, plus, b);
15) L: Screen bottom, f: find char, /.: find, H: screen top
16) yes, no output
